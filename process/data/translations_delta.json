During this time, Seats of Power in your home kingdom cannot be attacked or taken. Allegiances compete by holding as many Seats of Power as possible in any of the new kingdoms, rewarding them with event points. Points earned will not be lost when traveling to another kingdom. In the new kingdoms, Seats of Power will unlock using an accelerated schedule, each day providing better seats to conquer. Points earned during the event will depend on the seat being held by the allegiance. Bonus points are earned if your T1 is on the same kingdom. When the event ends, allegiances and their members will win rewards based on the total number of points earned. The Seat of Power unlock schedule will return to normal at the conclusion of the event.\nThere will be 2 new kingdoms available to pick from while the event is active, and you can freely travel to any of these kingdoms throughout the event. The event panel will include a \"Stake Your Claim\" teleport action allowing you to select a kingdom. Once you leave your original kingdom you cannot return as travel is only permitted between the new kingdoms.\nIt's important for you to know that at the end of the event you will be moved to the kingdom your T1 resides.\nIf you have not selected a new kingdom by the end of the event, you will be randomly moved to one. If a kingdom is overpopulated at the conclusion of the event, some allegiances will be moved to another kingdom. \n\nGood luck and thank you for playing Game of Thrones: Conquest!"
